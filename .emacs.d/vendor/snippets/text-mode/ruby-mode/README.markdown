# Snippets for Ruby Mode

## About

Comprehensive collection of Ruby snippets for
[yasnippet](http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/ "yasnippet - Google Code"). Note
that most of these snippets won't work (yet), since they were originally
automatically converted from the TextMate repository. This is a work in
progress.

Note that some of the snippets are changed from how they are defined in the
official Yasnippet distribution, with a preference towards how they are defined
in TextMate. I.e, the reject snippet is here triggered with 'rej' instead of
'reject'.

## Contributors

All snippets by Bjørn Arild Mæland <bjorn.maeland at gmail.com>, unless
otherwise stated.

Thanks to Jeff Wheeler for his work on the snippet_copier.py script!
